# Logo Implementation Plan

## Current State
The header currently displays the text "Shplit" as an h1 element with an info button on the left, styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Simple Static Logo
- Place logo file in `/public` directory
- Update Header component to display the logo
- Maintain text as fallback/alt text
- Pros: Simple, quick to implement
- Cons: No dynamic upload capability

### Option 2: Dynamic Logo Upload
- Add file upload functionality
- Implement server-side storage
- Add state management for logo URL
- Pros: More flexible, user-controlled
- Cons: More complex, requires backend support

## Recommended Approach
Given the current project structure and requirements, I recommend starting with Option 1 (Simple Static Logo) as it:
1. Provides immediate value
2. Can be enhanced later if needed
3. Maintains simplicity
4. Follows current project patterns

### Implementation Steps
1. Add logo file to `/public` directory
2. Update Header component to include logo:
   ```jsx
   <img 
     src="/logo.png" 
     alt="Shplit" 
     className="h-8 w-auto" 
   />
   ```
3. Adjust layout and spacing using Tailwind
4. Ensure responsive design
5. Add fallback to text if image fails to load

### Technical Considerations
- Image format: SVG preferred for scalability
- Size constraints: Recommend max height of 32px
- Responsive behavior: Maintain aspect ratio
- Accessibility: Proper alt text and ARIA attributes

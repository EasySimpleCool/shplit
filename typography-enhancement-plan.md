# Typography Enhancement Plan

## Current System Analysis
The current typography system follows a clear hierarchical scale with defined sizes:
- Emphasis: 64/Auto (largest)
- Header: 40/Auto
- Subheader: 24/Auto
- Body: 16/Auto
- Label: 12/Auto
- Tiny: 8/Auto (smallest)

## Proposed Addition: Section Title
We will add a new typography style called "Section Title" to bridge the gap between Header (40px) and Subheader (24px).

### Specifications
- Name: Section Title
- Size: 32/Auto
- Font Family: Inter (consistent with existing system)
- Weight: Medium (500)
- Use Case: Perfect for section divisions and important subsections that need more prominence than a Subheader but shouldn't compete with main Headers

### Implementation Steps
1. Add the new typography style to the design system
2. Update relevant CSS/styling files
3. Document the new style in the component library
4. Create usage guidelines for when to apply this new style

### Benefits
1. Creates a more balanced typographic scale
2. Provides an intermediate option for section titles
3. Maintains consistency with existing system while adding flexibility
4. Improves visual hierarchy for complex layouts

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve this plan
2. Switch to Code mode for implementation
3. Test the new style in various contexts
4. Update documentation
